Sensordrone-Helper
==================

# NOTE
Much of this library has been integrated into the new 1.2.0 Sensordrone library,
(helping scan to connect via Bluetooth, on/off runnables for pseudo sensor readings, etc..)
and as such, I don't plan on maintaining this all that much. I have updated it to work with
version 1.2.0 on the library.
If you are using SDAndroidLib-1.1.1, then you will need an older commit  of this library.

I wouldn't recommend using this library going forward, and starting to use the things from here that got
integrated into the API.

I didn't add any of the LED blinking things into the new SDAndroid library, but if you want them added in,
or have any other things you think should be added it, please let me know, or even contribute!

# About
An android helper library for the Sensordrone

This library contains useful methods for getting things up and running with your Sensordrone.

### Note: The newest version of Sensordrone Control no longer uses this library

You will need to add the following library to compile: 

1) SDAndroidLib-1.2.0.jar available at http://developer.sensordrone.com/downloads/

2) android.jar (I built this against Android API 10: Gingerbread)
